            "description": "Implemented a `MutationObserver` (later replaced by `setInterval`) in `content-script.js` for continuous scanning of reviews as the user scrolls. Added visual feedback: a 'scribe-beacon' button to toggle highlighting of gathered reviews and a brief animation for newly discovered reviews."

            "description": "Identified that the script failed on non-place pages (e.g., contributor profiles) due to reliance on `h1.DUwDvf`. Implemented URL-based place name extraction as the primary method, with `h1` as a fallback, ensuring broader compatibility. Confirmed highlighting functionality was restored and persistent."
